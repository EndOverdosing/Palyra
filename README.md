# Palyra Communicator

A secure, decentralized, and real-time communication application that facilitates direct peer-to-peer connections for video, audio, and text chat without a central server.

## Overview

This project leverages WebRTC technology, abstracted through the PeerJS library, to enable two users to connect directly through their web browsers. By sharing unique, dynamically generated IDs, users can establish a secure and private communication channel. The application is designed to be fully client-side, ensuring that media and data are streamed directly between peers.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Communication:** No central server handles video, audio, or chat data, ensuring privacy.
- **Video and Audio Calls:** High-quality, real-time audio and video streaming.
- **Screen Sharing:** Functionality to share your screen with the connected peer.
- **Text Chat:** A fully functional, real-time text messaging system.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean user interface that adapts to both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple Connection:** Users connect by sharing simple, unique peer IDs.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5:** For the core structure of the application.
- **CSS3:** For modern styling and a responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all client-side logic and functionality.
- **PeerJS:** A library that simplifies the implementation of WebRTC peer-to-peer connections.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Launch the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
2.  **Grant Permissions:** Allow the browser to access your camera and microphone when prompted.
3.  **Share Your ID:** Copy your unique ID and send it to the person you wish to connect with.
